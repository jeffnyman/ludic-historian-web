      <h1>Talking with ELIZA</h1>

      <hr>

      <section>
        <p class="nostyle">
          In between the two iterations of <em>The Sumerian Game</em> (in 1964 and 1966) and after BASIC had made its way on the scene (1964), another interesting simulation became known. This was not really a game, but it certainly was a simulation. There are some interesting aspects to <em>ELIZA</em> that you could argue should have prefigured a bit of what came later, the text adventure, although it's not actually clear that it did.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The Context</h2>

        <p>
          Joseph Weizenbaum was a professor at MIT in the Department of Electrical Engineering, working as part of something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Computer_Science_and_Artificial_Intelligence_Laboratory#Project_MAC">Project MAC</a>. In 1965, Weizenbaum introduced a computerized conversation simulator he called <em>ELIZA</em>. The most famous <em>ELIZA</em> transcript was published soon after in an article Weizenbaum wrote for the January 1966 volume of <em>Communications of the ACM</em>.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><em>Communications of the ACM</em> &mdash; "Computational Linguistics" - "ELIZA - A Computer Program For the Study of Natural Language Communication Between Man And Machine" (Vol 9, No 1 - Jan 1966) [ <a href="../assets/docs/eliza/weizenbaum-1966.pdf" data-size="1 MB">PDF version</a> ]</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          An important point there is that "ELIZA" is actually the name of the generalized conversation system that Weizenbaum came up with. Different scripts could be plugged into ELIZA to represent different characters or agents. The focus of the system was on the ability to converse with these characters/agents.
        </p>

        <p>
          But what does that actually mean?
        </p>

        <p>
          First, the context is that <em>ELIZA</em> itself was a reference to a working-class character in the play <em>Pygmalion</em>, written by George Bernard Shaw. In the play, Eliza Doolittle has to learn how to converse in a certain way. Essentially Eliza wants to interact with a different class of people and, as such, has to learn the skills of clear and expressive speech. Eliza Doolittle was thus a commoner who is “programmed” to speak and comport herself like a woman of the upper classes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus here, at a time when computers just started to use integrated chips, we see the idea of a computer program perhaps learning to interact with people and thus requiring the skills to converse with people.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Implementation</h2>

        <p>
          Okay, but what does all that actually mean from an implementation perspective?
        </p>

        <p>
          Weizenbaum's ELIZA was intended as a general conversational agent but it's also important to note that one of his goals was to show the superficiality of communication between humans and machines.
        </p>

        <p>
          The engine interpreted a separate, domain-specific script that determined its style of conversation. The most well-known script is the aforementioned "DOCTOR". This is the one that carries on the well-known "Rogerian therapist" conversations that appear in Weizenbaum's 1966 paper, and which are most commonly associated with the name "ELIZA." Indeed, the name "ELIZA" has basically come to mean "the ELIZA agent running the DOCTOR script." ELIZA can be seen as the precursor of many of the conversation interfaces and chatbots that we have become so familiar with today, such as Siri, but it worked over a much more clunky typewriter-based console.
        </p>

        <p>
          The original ELIZA program was implemented on an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/mainframe/mainframe_PP7094.html">IBM 7094</a> which was part of the Project MAC <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatible_Time-Sharing_System">Compatible Time-Sharing System</a> at MIT. The system was written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAD_(programming_language)">MAD</a> (<strong>M</strong>ichigan <strong>A</strong>lgorithm <strong>D</strong>ecoder) using some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLIP_(programming_language)">SLIP</a> (<strong>S</strong>ymmetric <strong>LI</strong>st <strong>P</strong>rocessor) libraries for the language.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can see a <a href="../assets/docs/manuals/SLIP-manual.pdf" data-size="4 MB">MAD-SLIP manual</a> from a long, three-volume 7090 user's guide.
        </p>

        <p>
          Only the DOCTOR script appears in the 1966 paper, not the ELIZA code that interprets that script, although the algorithm is described in a lot of detail.
        </p>

        <p>
          The common misconception that ELIZA was originally written in Lisp arose because shortly after the publication of the 1966 paper, Bernie Cosell wrote a version in Lisp, based upon the description of the algorithm in the 1966 paper. Cosell's version used a version of the published script, but he never saw the original ELIZA.
