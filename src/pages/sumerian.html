        <p class="nostyle">
          For this article, I'm going to take us to the early 1960s and look at a game that, for quite a long time, was obscured, if not entirely absent, from a lot of game history. This game shared an interesting context with a wider education initiative that was going on at the same time.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The Education Context</h2>

        <p>
          To understand the context in which <em>The Sumerian Game</em> came to be, it's important to understand the education context in that time frame.
        </p>

        <p>
          The early twentieth century had been characterized by a rapid expansion of high schools in rural America that were patterned on existing institutions located in larger cities. As education standards and curricular demands became more complex, these smaller school districts were often unable to keep pace with urban districts, mainly due to the latter having much larger on-hand staff.
        </p>

        <p>
          The formation of intermediate school districts for resource pooling were an attempt to mitigate this problem. One of those districts, created by the New York State Legislature in 1948, was called the <strong>B</strong>oard <strong>o</strong>f <strong>C</strong>ooperative <strong>E</strong>ducational <strong>S</strong>ervices (<strong>BOCES</strong>).
        </p>

        <p>
          The stated goal of BOCES was providing shared educational programs and services to school districts within the state. The idea was that the program could help smaller school districts, particularly those in the rural areas, to pool their resources. This pooling would allow those districts to purchase or develop programs and services that were financially out of reach for the individual organizations themselves.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Northern Westchester County BOCES Superintendent was a guy named Noble Gividen. Gividen's strong conviction was that the computer had a role to play in providing quality education. There was precedent for this. Since 1960, computer business simulations like <em>The Carnegie Tech Management Game</em> had been incorporated into college curricula. Gividen believed introducing similar programs into secondary education, suitably repurposed for the grade level, could provide major benefits to learning.
        </p>

        <h2>Gather Sources</h2>

        <p>
          Before getting into how this played out, it's worth noting that the main extant historical sources we have are the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><em>Two Computer-Based Economics Games for Sixth Graders</em>; Wing, Richard L. <em>The American Behavioral Scientist</em>; Princeton, N.J. Vol. 10, Issue. 3 (Nov 1966)</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>"The Production and Evaluation of Three Computer-based Economics Games for the Sixth Grade, Final Report", <em>U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare report</em>, Wing, Richard L. (June 1967)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Both of the above sources were published relatively close to each other and give us a lot of detail. So let's use that detail to reconstruct what we can.
