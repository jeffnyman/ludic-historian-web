      <h1>The Rise of BASIC</h1>

      <hr>

      <section>
        <p class="nostyle">
          The story here is about John George Kemeny and Thomas Eugene Kurtz. These two Dartmouth professors, via their own interests, came to believe that human-computer interaction would become a central part of everyday life both at home and in the workplace. It turned out that they were certainly correct.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The Context</h2>

        <p>
          Back in the late 1960s and into the mid 1970s, you could argue that knowing how to use a computer was virtually synonymous with knowing how to program one. High-level computer languages allowed programming to move from low-level numeric coding to high-level symbolic coding. These higher-level languages opened up programming to more people such that the spectrum of programming moved from scientists, to engineers, to business people, to basically anyone.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, the technology context and the programming language context had to evolve a bit for all that to become useful. This part of our story will take us to the Darthmouth Time Sharing System and the BASIC programming language.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the mid-1960s, using a computer was generally like playing chess by mail. You used a keypunch to enter a program on cards, turned them over to a trained operator and then waited for a printout of the results. Those results might not arrive until the next day. BASIC and the platform it ran on, the Dartmouth Time Sharing System, both sped up the process and demystified it. You told the computer to do something by typing words and math statements, and it did it, right away.
        </p>

        <p>
          Kemeny believed that computers would play an increasingly important role in everyday life, and that everyone at Dartmouth should be introduced to them.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          Our vision was that every student on campus should have access to a computer, and any faculty member should be able to use a computer in the classroom whenever appropriate. It was as simple as that.
          <span>John Kemeny, 1991 Interview</span>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Of course, Dartmouth couldn't give a computer to every student and faculty member. Computers were a pricey shared resource, normally capable of performing only one task at a time. That's why you typically handed your program over on punch cards and waited your turn.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the early 1960s, average citizens &mdash; even those who happened to be students at Ivy League schools with computing centers &mdash; had never encountered a computer in person. The machines were kept behind locked doors, where only certain people were allowed access to them.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Access at Dartmouth</h2>

        <p>
          In 1962, Kemeny and Kurtz facilitated free access to computing for all Dartmouth students through the implementation of time-sharing. They wanted to enable students in fields other than science and mathematics to use computers.
        </p>

        <p>
          An operative bit of context here is that IBM was promoting computing on college campuses like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The IBM system used batch processing, and, as part of the deal, some academic institutions in New England would receive computer time as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dartmouth assistant professor of mathematics John McCarthy, who would coin the term "artificial intelligence," contacted MIT and designated Kurtz as the liaison between the MIT machines and Dartmouth. It was via this circumstance that Kurtz was to promote at Dartmouth the uses and power of the computing system at MIT.
        </p>

        <p>
          Kemeny and Kurtz shopped around for a computer for Dartmouth, ultimately settling on a popular desk computer: the drum-based, sixteen-instruction LGP-30 (Librascope General Precision), a product of the Librascope company. They brought this to Dartmouth in 1959.
        </p>

        <p>
          Undergraduates Robert Hargraves, Steve Garland, Jorge Llacer, and Anthony Knapp pooled their resources to write an ALGOL 60 compiler for the machine. LGP-30 ALGOL programs were written on paper tape, but the compiler was set up in such a way that as many as five students could run their programs in only a quarter of an hour; they called the process <strong>SCALP</strong> (the <strong>S</strong>elf-<strong>C</strong>ontained <strong>AL</strong>GOL <strong>P</strong>rocessor): it was still batch processing, but streamlined.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the batch-processing problem could be solved, Kemeny and Kurtz, by this point, had ample proof that at least some Dartmouth undergraduates could and would make interesting use of computers.
        </p>

        <p>
          That brings us to another bit of operative context and goes back to what I mentioned a bit earlier.
        </p>

        <p>
          MIT and Bell Labs were experimenting with a new concept called time-sharing that would allow multiple users to work on the same computer nearly simultaneously. During a visit Kurtz had with John McCarthy at MIT, McCarthy suggested to him, "You guys ought to do time-sharing." McCarthy certainly knew of what he spoke because by 1959, MIT had already devised a system whereby user terminals were hooked up to a computer &mdash; a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-1 &mdash; and the computer's operating system would cycle through the terminals, one by one, spending a small amount of time running programs submitted by each terminal until a particular user's job was completed. Small jobs wouldn't take forever, but larger jobs would take more time.
        </p>

        <p>
          This was a revolutionary &mdash; and much fairer &mdash; way to exploit a computer's resources.
        </p>

        <p>
          Kurtz explained the time-sharing concept to Kemeny, noting that computer instruction might be possible for hundreds of students on campus. But not with their small LGP-30; although they had already demonstrated that multiple students could dispatch programs at a fairly rapid clip on the machine (with SCALP), still only one student at a time could make use of it. Dartmouth would first need to get ahold of a more powerful computer than the LGP-30 to satisfy Kurtz's vision.
        </p>

        <p>
          Kurtz approached General Electric (GE) based on a recommendation. Like at IBM, where computers were offered to high-profile firms or educational institutions at a discount as a marketing ploy, GE agreed to set a sixty percent discount on their computers. Kemeny managed to purchase a GE-225 and also the GE DATANET-30.
        </p>

        <p>
          Kemeny thus effectively provided the basis for creating the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System (DTSS) in 1964, rather than having to rely on another university's computer system (like MIT's) or in-house batch processing on a computer of modest power, like the LGP-30. One machine, the “slave” GE-225, was assigned the calculations, while the other machine, the “master” GE DATANET-30, was tasked with commutating with the terminals. After the DTSS gained traction, GE packaged the two computers as one: the GE-265, which came with the Dartmouth time-sharing software already installed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Kemeny proposed to Kurtz that they write a new language for DTSS; yet it wouldn't be their first crack at creating a new computer language. In 1956, they had programmed Darsimco (Dartmouth Simplified Code), designed to shortcut some of the tedium required when coding in the assembly language SAP (Symbolic Assembly Program) for the IBM 704. Their colleagues, however, failed to use it. There was also DOPE (Dartmouth Oversimplified Programming Experiment) for the LGP-30 that then-high school student Sidney Marshall wrote with Kemeny while taking calculus on campus; DOPE, however, was too limited.
        </p>

        <p>
          Perhaps instead of culling a subset of ALGOL or FORTRAN, there was a language simple enough for teaching purposes. Kurtz stumbled upon JOSS (JOHNN1AC Open Shop System), a timesharing system language built for the JOHNNIAC computer at RAND. But JOSS, too, had an unnatural syntax; for instance, decimal points weren't permitted with numbers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Based on Kemeny and Kurtz's designs for BASIC, Kemeny began writing the first BASIC compiler—which translated BASIC programs into machine code—on punch cards in 1963, well before the DTSS was in place; meanwhile, Kurtz oversaw the students who were working on the DTSS. Kemeny, who had never written a compiler before, needed to test his BASIC compiler on GE hardware, which hadn't arrived at Dartmouth yet. On the night of May 1, 1964, at around 4:00 AM, undergrads John McGeachie and Mike Busch finally had the DTSS operating system working and successfully ran slightly different BASIC programs simultaneously on separate teletypewriters.
        </p>

        <p>
          All Dartmouth BASIC implementations were compilers; BASIC interpreters require much less memory and computational power than compilers and thus became the standard on the early underpowered microcomputers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unlike many BASICs to come, Dartmouth BASIC was a compiler, which meant that it converted your entire program in one fell swoop into machine code that the computer could understand, rather than line by line every time you ran the program. It performed that task rapidly, especially by the leisurely standards of 1960s computing. If you were writing a very simple program, you would get your answer in a second or so. It might take longer to print it out, because the Teletypes could only do 10 characters a second.
        </p>

        <p>
          The historic moment at Dartmouth on May 1, 1964 at 4 a.m. was actually two historic moments. Not one brief BASIC program but two or three of them -- accounts vary -- ran simultaneously, proving both that BASIC worked and that the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System was capable of dealing with more than one user at a time.
        </p>

        <p>
          In June 1964, they became generally available to Dartmouth students, initially on 11 Teletype machines. The first version of BASIC had 14 commands, all with straightforward names and syntax that made sense.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then there was INPUT, a command that let a BASIC program accept alphanumeric characters typed in by a user. It wasn't among the initial 14, arriving only in the third revision of the language in 1966. But when it did, it made it possible to write far more interactive programs. Without INPUT, BASIC was mostly for solving math problems and doing simple simulations; with it, the language could do almost anything. Including play games.
        </p>

        <p>
          By letting non-computer scientists use BASIC running on the DTSS, Kemeny, Kurtz and their collaborators had invented something that was arguably the first real form of personal computing. But it didn't yet involve personal computers. That revolution got jump-started a decade later, when a New Mexico model rocket company called MITS launched the Altair 8800, the $497 build-it-yourself microcomputer ($621 assembled) that launched the PC revolution.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <a href="../assets/docs/altair/Poptronics-1975-01-Altair-Intro.pdf" data-size="660 KB">January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics</a> contained the Altair notice. Paul Allen and Bill Gates knew they wanted to try to make the Altair run BASIC, a language they'd both learned in its original timeshared-via-Teletype form at the Lakeside School in Seattle.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <a href="../assets/docs/altair/Poptronics-1975-02-Altair-Program.pdf" data-size="630 KB">February 1975 issue</a> also contained some interesting stuff.
        </p>

        <p>
          Actually, Allen had been ruminating about the possibility of building his own BASIC even before he knew about the Altair. “There hadn't been attempts to write a full-blown programming language for a microprocessor,” he explains. “But when the chips leading up to the 8080 processor became available, I realized we could write a program for it that would be powerful enough to run BASIC.” Famously, they wrote the first draft of Altair BASIC without having access to an Altair, using a simulator they ran on a Digital Equipment PDP-10 minicomputer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Allen and Gates' BASIC partnership became a company, known at first as Micro-Soft. They licensed the language to MITS, which sold it for a hefty $500, marked down to $75 if you bought it bundled with Altair hardware. Or you could get it for free by pirating it—something that so many early microcomputer owners did that Gates wrote a legendary open letter bemoaning the rampant theft of Micro-Soft's intellectual property.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even so, BASIC being available on a microcomputer was a big deal. “There are two keys to the new computer revolution,” declared an unsigned article -- David Bunnell, in charge of publications at MITS, says he almost certainly wrote it -- announcing Altair BASIC in the <a href="../assets/docs/altair/ComputerNotes-1975_01_01-Altair.pdf" data-size="2 MB">April 1975 issue of MITS' Computer Notes newsletter</a>. “One is computers must be inexpensive and the other is computers must be understandable. With the Altair 8800 and Altair BASIC, both of these criteria have been met.”
        </p>

        <p>
          That was true, but it was only the beginning of the story. The Altair and its earliest rivals catered to hobbyists who were comfortable flipping switches and wielding soldering guns. In 1977, a new wave of PCs arrived that were aimed at a far broader swath of consumers, including Apple's Apple II, Commodore's PET 2001 and Radio Shack's TRS-80. And one of the things that made them consumer PCs was that they came with BASIC.
        </p>

        <p>
          The PET offered a variant of Microsoft BASIC from the start. Apple and Radio Shack started out with rudimentary variants of the language -- Apple's was written by cofounder Steve Wozniak himself -- before acquiring the rights to distribute Microsoft's version. For the next few years, nearly every microcomputer of any significance came with Microsoft BASIC, including models from companies such as Atari and Texas Instruments.
        </p>

        <p>
          There were other microcomputer BASICs besides Microsoft's. In the early days, the best-known of them was CBASIC, created by a naval officer named Gordon Eubanks. His version was particularly popular among people developing commercial programs -- which, at the time, were as likely to be written in BASIC as in any other language.
        </p>

        <p>
          A key reason for Microsoft BASIC's importance: It was unavoidable. When you turned on an early microcomputer such as the TRS-80, it dumped you directly into the language. You could load a program off tape cassette or floppy disk if you chose, but you could also simply begin typing a new one. These computers begged to be programmed in a way that their descendants do not.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unlike both Dartmouth BASIC and CBASIC, Microsoft BASIC was an interpreted language, which meant that it converted each line of a BASIC program into machine code on the fly, every time you ran the program. That made it sluggish, especially if you didn't know any hacks for speeding up stuff like animated graphics.
        </p>

        <p>
          But it also meant that anybody could examine the original program for anything written in Microsoft BASIC, including commercial software distributed on cassette or floppy disk. You could learn from it, tweak it or steal snippets of it for your own projects. It had many of the virtues of open-source software long before the concept had that name.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you needed help learning BASIC's lingo, there was a near-infinite amount of reference material, all of which included programs you could type in and customize. Like the language itself, the works documenting BASIC tended to be rather informal by computer-science standards.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1972, for instance, Bob Albrecht of the People's Computer Company in Menlo Park, California wrote a primer with a wonderfully evocative title: My Computer Likes Me When I Speak in BASIC.
        </p>

        <p>
          The single most influential book of the BASIC era was not a textbook -- at least not officially. It was 101 BASIC Computer Games, later known as BASIC Computer Games and edited, in both versions, by David H. Ahl.
        </p>

        <p>
          The tome grew out of Ahl's work as educational marketing manager for Digital Equipment Corporation's PDP-8 line of minicomputers. Around 1971, he created BASIC versions of two games that had originally been written in DEC's FOCAL language, Hammurabi (in which the player governed ancient Sumeria) and Lunar Lander (exactly what it sounds like).
        </p>

        <p>
          Their popularity led him to include BASIC games in EDU, a DEC newsletter he edited. Many of them were contributed by readers -- especially high school students -- and in 1973, DEC published an anthology, 101 BASIC Computer Games.
        </p>

        <p>
          Shortly after Ahl left DEC in 1974, he started a magazine, Creative Computing, devoting a great deal of its space to BASIC. Then he acquired the rights to publish 101 BASIC Computer Games under the title BASIC Computer Games.
