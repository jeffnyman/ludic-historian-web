      <h1>The Crowther and Woods Adventure</h1>

      <hr>

      <section>
        <p>
          This one has a bit of a tangled history but an easy start to that history. Sometime in 1975, a guy named Will Crowther wrote a game called "Adventure" which was then expanded by another guy named Don Woods. The original version of this game, abandoned by Crowther in early 1976, was thought to be lost forever until it was unearthed in 2007. From these recovered sources, we're able to reconstruct some of the history.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>????</h2>

        <p>
          One of the major sources of information for "Adventure" is <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/001/2/000009/000009.html">"Somewhere Nearby is Colossal Cave: Examining Will Crowther's Original 'Adventure' in Code and in Kentucky"</a> by Dennis Jerz. (<a href="../assets/docs/adventure/Adventure-Dennis-Jerz.pdf" data-size="4 MB">PDF version</a> available as well.) Important parts are stated in the abstract:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          This paper analyzes previously unpublished files recovered from a backup of Woods's student account at Stanford.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          So that tells us we're dealing with some primary materials. The "Wood's student account" refers to the aforementioned Don Woods who plays an important role in the history of this game. Also stated in the abstract:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          New interviews with Crowther, Woods, and their associates (particularly members of Crowther's family) provide new insights on the precise nature of Woods's significant contributions.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          That tells us we're dealing with the primary sources.
        </p>

        <p>
          The timing of the game is really what matters here, at least from a historical chronology perspective. Interviews with Crowther and his family members &mdash; sister, two children, and ex-wife &mdash; all confirm that the game was created shortly after Crowther's divorce, which they all say happened in mid-1975. Betty Bloom, Crowther's sister, recalls spending her sabbatical from school with Crowther during the time he created the game and has stated that she was a regular playtester. According to Bloom's records, that sabbatical took place during the academic year of 1975 to 76.
        </p>

        <p>
          In separate telephone interviews, Crowther's children &mdash; Sandy (born in 1967) and Laura (born in 1970) &mdash; recall being eight and “less than six,” respectively, when they first played the game. This was during a school vacation when they were staying with their father. None of the family remembers which school vacations were involved. Betty Bloom and Sandy both indicate Laura had already turned six, which would place the creation of "Adventure" after Laura's sixth birthday, which was in January of 1976.
        </p>

        <p>
          From Jerz's paper:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          All Crowther family testimony is consistent with the 1975-76 date range. Responding to a direct request via e-mail, Crowther (2001) dated his original "Adventure" to 1975, "give or take a year."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          John Gilbert, who was one of Don Woods' Stanford classmates, had written "I'm pretty certain it was between October and December 1975 when Don and I first ran across it," referring to the original "Adventure." This supports Laura's memory of being “less than six” and thus makes a plausible case for 1975.
        </p>

        <p>
          That brings us to Don Woods. In <a href="https://www.avventuretestuali.com/interviste/woods-eng/">an interview</a>, Woods recounts coming across the game:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          I don't recall the exact day, but it was early in 1976, perhaps March or April. I was a graduate student in the Computer Science department at Stanford, and overheard another student talking about a game he had found on the Stanford Medical Center's computer. I had him fetch me a copy so I could try it on the Sail computer.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          The "Sail computer" here likely refers to a computer in the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some time before 11 March 1977, Woods contacted Crowther, who gave him access to the source code. By 23 March, we see in Woods' records a version with some twenty additional lines of code &mdash; a low-level subroutine that Woods supplied in order to get the source to compile. A 31 March set of source files again show only minor tweaks. The evidence demonstrates Woods was working on Crowther's source code during March, but during that month we see no evidence of what would later be some substantive creative expansions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Woods must have been very busy during April. By mid-May, hackers at MIT had noticed the game. After they solved it, Tim Anderson said that "the true lunatics began to think about how they could do it better", and by June, "Zork" had already taken a recognizable form.
        </p>

        <p>
          It sounds like Woods produced a 250 point version on his way to finalizing a 350 point version several months later. John Everett recalls:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          My best recollection is that ADVENT.EXE first appeared on the PDP-10s at ADP (the old First Data in Waltham, Mass.) in 1977. It was an incomplete version which only had about 250 points worth of treasure. I seem to recall that there was nothing past the troll bridge but an 'under construction' sign or some such. I believe our copy came from WPI, but word at the time was it was developed at Stanford. Two or three months later we got the full 350 point game.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          The original 350-point version is separately ported in July 1977 by Kent Blackett. We see source code from the period with the following:
        </p>

        <pre><code>
          ADVENT.FOR: C REV. 17 ADVENTURES MODIFIED BY KENT BLACKETT ENGINEERING
          SYSTEMS GROUP DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORP. 15-JUL-77 ORIGINAL VERSION WAS FOR
          DECSYSTEM-10 THIS VERSION IS FOR FORTRAN IV-PLUS UNDER THE IAS OPERATING
          SYSTEM ON THE PDP-11/70.
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          This is followed by Bob Supnik, circa October (date given in his own source code). It has 366 maximum points and the cumulative efforts of Blackett and Supnik (probably) represents the first modification of the game past the Woods version.
        </p>

        <p>
          Regarding the source code itself, from Jerz's paper:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          In response to my request, Les Earnest ([Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab] executive officer, 1965-1980), Bruce Baumgart (former Stanford Ph.D. student, now an employee of the Internet Archive) and Martin Frost (systems manager of Stanford's CS department) kindly gave Don Woods web-based access to a tape backup of his Stanford student account. Woods chose five files from that backup tape, which he identified as components of Crowther's original FORTRAN 4 source code, and made them available for scholarly study.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          There are two specific files, representing the data and the code, and they are dated 11 March 1977. According to Woods, these files represent Crowther's original work. That archive includes three more files from later in March of that same year. These apparently show some of the first changes Woods made in both the data and the code.
