        <h2>The Initial Patent</h2>

        <p>
          We can start with <a href="../assets/docs/patents/US2455992.pdf" data-size="590 KB">United States Patent number 2,455,992</a>. The first part of that document sets the stage for this:
        </p>

        <pre class="longquote">
          "This invention relates to a device with which a game can be played. The game is of such a character that it requires care and skill in playing it or operating the device with which the game is played. Skill can be increased with practice and the exercise of care contributes to success."
        </pre>

        <p>
          That patent was issued to Thomas T. Goldsmith and Estle Ray Mann, who applied for the patent on 25 January 1947 although didn't actually receive it until 14 December 1948. The patent is for what can now be considered the world's first <em>description</em> of an interactive game played on a cathode-ray tube.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Description" is a key phrase there because while the patent was assigned to Allen B. DuMont Laboratories, whether it was manufactured to any degree is unclear. Accounts suggest that there were some handmade prototypes that were created but there is no indication that any actual manufacturing was done.
        </p>

        <p>
          We do have some schematics.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
          Aside from the above patent and prototype schematics, there is no known working model of the Cathode-Ray Tube Amusement Device in existence.

        <h2>The Basis of the Design</h2>

        <p>
          The key players here, Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann, were physicists that specialized in the development of cathode ray tube readings of electronic signal outputs, specifically as used in the development of televisions and monitors. As part of that work, the two men came up with the idea of creating a simple electronic game inspired by World War II radar displays. That's effectively what the above patent description is describing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Goldsmith became obsessed with electronics, especially crystal radio sets, a new technology that had just become popular. In 1931, he went to Cornell to get his Ph.D. in physics, where he began researching a device that was becoming essential for electronic communications: the cathode-ray tube.
        </p>

        <p>
          The idea was that by connecting a cathode ray tube to an oscilloscope and providing knobs that controlled the angle and trajectory of the light traces displayed on that oscilloscope, it was possible to create a kind of "missile game." When some screen overlays were used, this could create the effect of firing missiles at various targets.
        </p>

        <p>
          From the patent itself:
        </p>

        <pre class="long">
          "In carrying out the invention a cathode-ray tube is used upon the face of which the trace of the ray or electron beam can be seen. One or more targets, such as pictures of airplanes, for example, are placed upon the face of the tube and controls are available to the player so that he can manipulate the trace or position of the beam which is automatically caused to move across the face of the tube. This movement of the beam may be periodic and its repetition rate may be varied. Its path is preferably caused to depart from a straight line so as to require an increased amount of skill and care for success in playing the game."
        </pre>

        <p>
          The basis of the technology requires understanding that a cathode-ray tube is a device that can register and control the quality of an electronic signal. Once connected to an oscilloscope, the electronic signal is visually represented on the oscilloscope's monitor as a beam of light. The quality of the electronic signal is measured by how the beam of light moves and curves on the display. The control knobs on such a device can adjust the strength of the electronic signal that's output by the cathode-ray tube. Thus by adjusting the signal strength the beams of light that output onto the oscilloscope can appear to move and curve.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was exactly this effect that would allow a player to control the trajectory on which the ray of light moves. Once screen overlays with target graphics printed onto them were placed on the oscilloscope screen, the player would then try to adjust the ray to deflect onto the target.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the interesting effects that Goldsmith and Mann came up with was a way to make it obvious to the player when the target was hit. From the patent:
        </p>

        <pre class="long">
          "The game can be made more spectacular, and the interest therein both from the player's and the observer's standpoint can be increased, by making a visible explosion of the cathode-ray beam take place when the target is hit."
        </pre>

        <p>
          This involved the use of a sliding contactor, which was a relay switch that controlled the flow of energy through the circuit. By adjusting that sliding contactor to overpower a resistor in the cathode-ray tube with a powerful enough signal, it would make the display go out of focus and appear as a blurred round spot. Thus was created the appearance of an explosion.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although the <em>Cathode-Ray Tube Amusement Device</em> is indeed the first patented electronic game and is displayed on a monitor, many would not and, in fact, do not consider it an actual computer game and certainly not a video game. There's a good reason for that as the device, as envisioned, is purely mechanical and doesn't use any programming or computer generated graphics. In fact, there is no computer or memory device used at all in the creation or execution of the game.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alex Magoun, a historian at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, notes that the device was not what we would consider much of a video game today. "There's no computer, no microprocessor generating random airplane paths. They are just sticking targets on the picture tube and then using a couple of electromechanical controls to try to guide an electron beam. In that respect, it is not a fully developed technology by any means."
        </p>

        <p>
          Magoun speculates that Goldsmith's invention was only a demo and no actual prototype was made. We don't know this for sure, but there are other reasons to belive it beyond the technological. "DuMont was constantly strapped for funds," Magoun says. "[That was] the whole story of that company from the 30s into the 60s." Sure enough, in 1960 Allen B. DuMont sold his remaining shares to Fairchild Camera, marking the end of DuMont Labs' short but influential run.
