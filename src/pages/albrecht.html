      <h1>Albrecht and People's Computing</h1>

      <hr>

      <section>
        <h2>Bob Albrecht and Medicine Shows</h2>

        <p>
          Let's start here with a guy named Bob Albrecht. A lot of what I quote here is taken from an <a href="https://hclemuseum.wordpress.com/2015/07/09/interview-with-bob-albrecht-by-jon-cappetta-2/">interview with Bob Albrecht</a> from 2015. Unfortunately, the interview is conducted in such a way that it can make the history a bit hard to reason about, which I'll try to correct for here.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the early 1960s, Albrecht was in the process of teaching FORTRAN. In Albrecht's words from the interview:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          Around the early 1960s ... I was traveling all over the country to teachers' conferences giving papers and running workshops. When BASIC came along in 1964, by that time I was already running a course for high school students. So I started teaching high school students Fortran Programming in 1962.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Also from the interview:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          In 1962 I began to teach high school students. ... I talked the University of Colorado Denver Center into going for a National Science Foundation grant. Control Data than provided a 160A, which would run Fortran paper tape, punch a paper tape on flexi readers and feed it in. So we ran that. My students were the teachers; so, they taught students and teachers in the evening classes under this NSF grant. I wrote about these kids in Datamation magazine in about 1964 and the article I wrote was called a Modern Day Medicine Show.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          The reference there is to <em>Datamation</em> magazine in July of 1963 and the article Albrecht wrote was called <a href="../assets/docs/pcc/modern-day-medicine-show-1963.pdf" data-size="1 MB">"A modern-day medicine show"</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          A key part of that article was the focus of a spring 1962 course with students from George Washington High School:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          Emphasis was placed on the use of computers as a computational tool to assist students in solving mathematical problems.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          This led to a summer course that same year with the following focus:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          This course was conducted on a seminar basis, using the algebra of polynomials as the mathematical subject. The instructors posed problems. The students did the required mathematical analysis, developed problem solving procedures, programmed their solutions in FORTRAN and ran their problems on the 160A.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC_160_series">CDC 160 series</a> was a series of minicomputers built by Control Data Corporation. The CDC 160 and CDC 160-A were 12-bit minicomputers. According to Albrecht, the context of all this was:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          We picked up the 160A moved it into George Washington High school and for an entire day my students ran demonstrations for different classes that were brought in. Similar to an old fashion medicine show of some guy standing up there trying to sell phony medicine, it struck with me, that this was like this with my students as the barkers.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          According to the <em>Datamation</em> article, the program was extended to "eight other schools in Denver and Jefferson counties." You can see some of the <a href="../assets/docs/pcc/medicine-show-media-coverage-1963.pdf" data-size="320 KB">media coverage at the time</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          But, pretty soon, Albrecht turned to BASIC. In his words:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          I said that's it! No more Fortran, so I started traveling all over the country crusading for BASIC. ... I lobbied, ranted, and raved for BASIC.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          This focus clearly seems to be that BASIC was better suited to the kind of work that Albrecht was doing with students, in that it was more accessible to them as compared to FORTRAN.
        </p>

        <p>
          A few references are given in the interview and those reference refer to a booklet called <em>Introduction to an Algorithmic Language (BASIC)</em> which Albrect had a hand in. This was published in 1968 by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. Another reference is the book <em>Computer Methods in Mathematics</em> which was published in 1969. Further situating the history, Albrecht in the interview refers to the "Midpenisula Free University." This ran from 1966 to 1971 but had its most active years in 1968 and 1968. (I have no idea what the "2848" referred to in the interview means in this context.)
        </p>

        <p>
          This history is also situated when Albrecht mentions Hewlett Packard's first programmable calculator, which he mistakenly remebers as the 9600. HP's first such calculator awas the 9100A which came out in March of 1968, followed by the 9100B in the fall of 1969. The Wang calculator also being mentioned would have been the 7800 series which came out in mid 1969.

        <h2>The Portola Institute</h2>

        <p>
          All of this history starts to take us into something called the Portola Institute. Albrecht lays the scene for us:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          Every Thursday evening I would run computer programming, wine tasting, and Greek dancing parties. A guy named Dick Raymond came to one of these. Dick told us how he had an idle, non-profit corporation that isn't doing anything right now, and this looks like something that might be fun to do.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          The non-profit mentioned was Portola. This was billed as a "nonprofit educational foundation" that Dick Raymond had started up in Menlo Park, California in 1966.
        </p>

        <p>
          A guy named Stewart Brand came to Portola and set up his group which eventually, via Portola's resources, produced and published the <em>Whole Earth Catalog</em>, the first issue of which came out in 1968. That first issue notes that the catalog is one division of "The Portola Institute" and that other activities of the Institute include "computer education for all grade levels" and "simulation games for classroom use." That last point is clearly what I'm interested in and where this history will start to take us.
        </p>

        <p>
          Working with LeRoy Finkel, Albrecht formed a group within Portola called DYMAX, the name of which came from, according to Albrecht, the "dymaxian world of Buckminster Fuller." Albrecht describes it:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          My little group eventually split off. We went and found a cheap warehouse in Redwood City and set up there. We had a couple of PDP-8 computers on loan. The PDP-8 ran four terminals with BASIC using high-speed paper tape input, 10 characters a second and high-speed printer output — Teletype model 33. So various people came drifting in to use this equipment.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          It was around this time that Albrecht mentions he produced a book called <a href="../assets/docs/pcc/My-Computer-Likes-Me-When-I-Speak-in-BASIC.pdf" data-size="1 MB">"My Computer Likes Me"</a>. To situate the history, this book was published in June of 1972. This book apparently coincided with a general focus of the group on starting to write and publish books that were self-teaching guides for various things.
        </p>

        <p>
          That context, plus being inspired by the <em>Whole Earth Catalog</em>, focused Albrecht's desire to create a periodical. It's that periodical we'll turn to next.
